# 02TodoList - Simple Todo List Application

## About the Project
02TodoList is a straightforward todo list app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets you add, delete, and clear tasks with ease. Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they stick around even after a page refresh. The app sports a clean, modern interface that works great on any device.

This is the second project in the **githup_mini_web_projects** repository, aimed at demonstrating core web development skills.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Type a task and hit submit or press Enter to add it.
- **Delete Tasks**: Each task has a trash icon for quick deletion.
- **Clear All Tasks**: Wipe the entire list with one click.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks persist across sessions thanks to localStorage.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks sharp and works smoothly on both mobile and desktop.
